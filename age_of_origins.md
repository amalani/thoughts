# General

## First things - you're new to the alliance - what are the things you should know?
1. Big alliances usually have multiple main alliances as well as friend or farm alliances. A farm alliance is an alliance where members maintain their secondary accounts as just farms to grow/gather resources. Only owners of those farms should be attacking them. 
2. Understand what are your friend/farm alliances - you can see it in the alliance section inside relationships. Remember the alliance names. Do not attack them. You'll see members attack their own farms - do not join the attack.
3. The Alliance battle list will show all active battles - typically, when someone wants you to do a group attack - they'll ask you to join or post in the chat. It's courteous to not join the other attacks the member might be doing. They could be attacking someone they've scouted, or worse - their own farm - and you shouldn't be attacking member farms. 
4. Know which are the big alliances (top 5) - they have a lot of fire power and can destroy your city (or the entire alliances). You can see alliance strength by clicking Commmander -> Alliance. 
5. If you don't know something or when in doubt - ask.

## Game navigation (How to do?)
1. See all current and upcoming event list -> Click orange glowing icon in bottom left corner.

# Events / Rallies
## Raid the ruins - Rally with alliance members
Everyday you get 1-2 attempts at starting or joining a rally to raid the ruins. It is good to have many people join the rally as that gives bigger rewards. 
1. Since there are limited number of attempts, it's better to announce in alliance chat when you are ready and see if others can join. Even if there are people online, they may not be able to join since their troops may be farming or attacking far away.
2. Don't start the rally directly. Ask in chat first how many can join. Get confirmation of how much time they need if their troops are returning and then start rally. That way most people can join and the chance is not wasted.
3. If 1 or 2 people join the rally, disband it - and go later when more people are availble. This helps provide bigger rewards and doesn't waste a chance. You can cancel rally before it starts by going to Battle Log -> Rally -> disband (person who started rally can do this.)


## Titan upgrade events
1. There are multiple events that help you upgrade the Titan 1) Doom's iron grip, Mother of Dooom, Medici's treasure.
2. These are individual events - you get ~10 attempts - and even though the demon is far away, your troops will take 15 seconds to go there, and 15 to return. 
3. Pick you best troops -> higher troops and fire power means more damage, and more rewards.
4. Click event list -> find the event - Attack. Let the attack happen, troops return quickly. Then heal the troops in the hospital, then attack again. Do this until all your attempts are over.
This will give you things to upgrade the Titan.


## War
## Wounded troops and reducing losses
- When defending (or reinforcing), you can reduce your army losses by ensuring the hosital and all the small medical center buildings are upgraded to highest level. When your troops are killed while defending, they go to the hospital (upto the hospital limit) - when the limit is full, any more killed troops will be permanently lost.
- It's much cheaper and quicker to heal wounded troops than creating new ones.
- You can see your current hospital and wounded limit by clicking on the fleet/troops icon (on the left side of the city wall)
