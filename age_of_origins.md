# General

## First things - you're new to the alliance - what are the things you should know?
1. Big alliances usually have multiple main alliances as well as friend or farm alliances. A farm alliance is an alliance where members maintain their secondary accounts as just farms to grow/gather resources. Only owners of those farms should be attacking them. 
2. Understand what are your friend/farm alliances - you can see it in the alliance section inside relationships. Remember the alliance names. Do not attack them. You'll see members attack their own farms - do not join the attack.
3. The Alliance battle list will show all active battles - typically, when someone wants you to do a group attack - they'll ask you to join or post in the chat. It's courteous to not join the other attacks the member might be doing. They could be attacking someone they've scouted, or worse - their own farm - and you shouldn't be attacking member farms. 
4. Know which are the big alliances (top 5) - they have a lot of fire power and can destroy your city (or the entire alliances). You can see alliance strength by clicking Commmander -> Alliance. 
5. If you don't know something or when in doubt - ask.

## Game navigation (How to do?)
1. See all current and upcoming event list -> Click orange glowing icon in bottom left corner.

# Events / Rallies
## Raid the ruins - Rally with alliance members
Everyday you get 1-2 attempts at starting or joining a rally to raid the ruins. It is good to have many people join the rally as that gives bigger rewards. 
1. Since there are limited number of attempts, it's better to announce in alliance chat when you are ready and see if others can join. Even if there are people online, they may not be able to join since their troops may be farming or attacking far away.
2. Don't start the rally directly. Ask in chat first how many can join. Get confirmation of how much time they need if their troops are returning and then start rally. That way most people can join and the chance is not wasted.
3. If 1 or 2 people join the rally, disband it - and go later when more people are availble. This helps provide bigger rewards and doesn't waste a chance. You can cancel rally before it starts by going to Battle Log -> Rally -> disband (person who started rally can do this.)


## Titan upgrade events
1. There are multiple events that help you upgrade the Titan 1) Doom's iron grip, Mother of Dooom, Medici's treasure.
2. These are individual events - you get ~10 attempts - and even though the demon is far away, your troops will take 15 seconds to go there, and 15 to return. 
3. Pick you best troops -> higher troops and fire power means more damage, and more rewards.
4. Click event list -> find the event - Attack. Let the attack happen, troops return quickly. Then heal the troops in the hospital, then attack again. Do this until all your attempts are over.
This will give you things to upgrade the Titan.


## War
## Wounded troops and reducing losses
- When defending (or reinforcing), you can reduce your army losses by ensuring the hosital and all the small medical center buildings are upgraded to highest level. When your troops are killed while defending, they go to the hospital (upto the hospital limit) - when the limit is full, any more killed troops will be permanently lost.
- It's much cheaper and quicker to heal wounded troops than creating new ones.
- You can see your current hospital and wounded limit by clicking on the fleet/troops icon (on the left side of the city wall)


## Upgrading cities
I know it's tempting to go for increasing city level and ignoring others but want to suggest you all a few things to help you be stronger. Increasing city levels is good but try to balance with other things:

- Try to increase embassy - that will help others reinforce you (others can only send as many troops as your embassy can hold)
- Try to increase medical units - that will reduce your losses as more troops will be wounded instead of killed. wounded is cheaper and faster to recover.
- Try to increase deployment center - that will help you do bigger rallies for ruins and attacks - which means more people can join if you miss David/Najma big rallies. You need leader points for this, you can get some for free through exploration (free attempt button to change items at bottom of explore page). Or if you choose to use gold, get 500 for 2500 gold.
- Research hp/defense to reduce troop losses in battles.

Instead of focusing purely on growth, balance growth and sustainence and recovery.

## Kill event
Kill event is a biweekly thing that happens at the last phase of Strongest command (Phase 5). During this time, you can attack anyone as well as expect an attack anytime. There are points for killing (during attack or defense). People are looking for level 4 or higher troops to kill. Level 3 or lower troops don't give kill event points.

- Tap on events list to see how much time is left for kill event. Or you can see clock at the top left.
- Expect an attack at any time. Try to shield up and always protect your troops. It's much easier and quicker to heal troops than to create them. Resources are easier to gather if you lose them. Rebuilding troops can take weeks sometimes. Try to save troops first.
- If you arent going to be active/sleeping - try to put on a shield. If your city doesnt have higher level troops or resources, you will likely not get attacked because people are trying to get kill points so there is no reason to attack you so no need for shield.
- If you don't have shield or don't want to use shield, try to use up resources and hide troops. Peoplke won't attack you then.
- You can hide troops at Alliance fort (one fleet) or alliance flags for long period of time. If some member says they are going to shield, you can hide troops by reinforcing shield cities too. 
- You can hide troops by sending them to gather but try to check again when the time expires so you can send them back. Gold mind is slowest - so you can send troops for longest time there. - If you send them to elite mines - time can change based on how many other members are gathering there so elite mines are unpredictable.
- When you have peace shield up - you can defend other members by reinforcing them. This will wound your members up to hospital limit so you can avoid killed troops too. You can also get KE points this way while defending by as you'll kill the attacker's troops.

Peace shield
- You can't put on a peace shield when you are attacking. If you have fleets or scouts going out and you want to quickly put on shield, recall your fleets first.
- If you're being attacked, you can put up shield then to cause some damage to the attackers troops that are coming to you (or get stuck)
- Some stronger members can even break shields. Shields prevent against most players but not all.
