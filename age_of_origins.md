## Raid the ruins Rally with alliance members
Everyday you get 1-2 attempts at starting or joining a rally to raid the ruins. It is good to have many people join the rally as that gives bigger rewards. 
1. Since there are limited number of attempts, it's better to announce in alliance chat when you are ready and see if others can join. Even if peole are online, they may not be able to join since troops may be farming.
2. Don't start the rally directly. Ask in chat first how many can join. Get confirmation of how much time they need if their troops are returning and then start rally. That way most people can join and the chance is not wasted.
3. If 1 or 2 people join the rally, disband it - and go later when more people are availble. This helps provide bigger rewards and doesn't waste a chance. You can cancel rally before it starts by going to Battle Log -> Rally -> disband (person who started rally can do this.)
